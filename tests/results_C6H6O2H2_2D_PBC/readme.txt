This 2D surface uses two essentially decoupled OH rotors to test the exact solutions for 
independent rotors under periodic boundary conditions.  The "flat" PES treats the two rotors 
as completely free.  Turning off he periodic boundary conditions also allows the solutions
to be tested for the case of two coexisting particles in independent 1D boxes.
