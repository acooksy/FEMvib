This B3LYP/cc-pVDZ PES was calculated for R12 and R13 = 1.0 to 1.8 A, 
(C = atom 1) in 0.05 A increments (17 values along each coord) 
and for A213 = 128.85 to 178.85 dg in 5 dg increments (11 values), 
for a total of 17x17x11=3180 points.  
The result was then mirrored to obtain values for A213 > 180 dg.
